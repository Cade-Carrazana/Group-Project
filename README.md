# Group-Project
Rocio, Enzo, and I attempt to create something for the group project. For our group, we did a volume calculator. It starts with a menu selecting from 1 to 8 which shape you would like to select. Choosing any of them sends you to where the screen is asking you to input the integers. The integers are then sent to a formula such as Volume = (4 / 3) * PI * radius * radius * radius for sphere at 2.
Picking 0 exits the calculator. There is one issue with this project. In the case of number 4, the answer would not appear.
Anyways, that is all we can say about the volume calculator.
