# Group-Project
Rocio, Enzo, and I attempt to create something for the group project. For our group, we did a volume calculator. It starts with a menu selecting from 1 to 8 which shape you would like to select.
Picking 0 exits the calculator. As always, there are some issues with this project. For starters, after inputting some numbers, you were greeted by a selection to choose M to go back to the Main Menu or R to repeat. However, with 1 and 2, M repeated to ask to type in the inputs, instead of going back to the main menu. Also, in the case of number 4, the answer would not appear.
Anyways, that is all we can say about the volume calculator.
